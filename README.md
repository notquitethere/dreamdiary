A Most Portentous Dream Diary
A Most Portentous Dream Diary
 Updated 3 minutes ago
Three years of dreams recorded in a diary, each with interpretations.

This project was made in Inform 7, with a corpus drawn from over 3700 dream entries in three different Victorian dream diaries found on Project Gutenberg.

Sample:

Monday the 26th of March In my sleep I dreamed I didn't know I was in danger. Thus: "To dream of being in danger shows success in life; to shun it misfortune ." Not what I always anticipated!

Tuesday the 27th of March I had this dream I was reading in a school. "To dream you are reading an agreeable book, shows you will be successful in love, and that you will become rich. To dream of attending school, indicates distinction in literary work."

Wednesday the 28th of March I slept like a baby!! I dreamed I suddenly became arrested. "To see respectable-looking strangers arrested, foretells that you desire to make changes, and new speculations will be subordinated by the fear of failure."

Thursday the 29th of March Today it is the day we clean the sheets. I learned I was bigamous. I had two melding dreams. First I dreamed I was delighting a tumble. Then I dreamed I was in danger. "To dream of experiencing delight over any event, signifies a favorable turn in affairs. To dream that you tumble off of any thing, denotes that you are given to carelessness, and should strive to be prompt with your affairs. To dream of being in a perilous situation, and death seems iminent,{sic} denotes that you will emerge from obscurity into places of distinction and honor; but if you should not escape the impending danger, and suffer death or a wound, you will lose in business and be annoyed in your home, and by others."

Friday the 30th of March Today it is Good Friday. I feel like I'm starving. I dreamed two combined dreams. First I dreamed I was mourning a register. Then I dreamed I was yawning. "To dream that you are dressed in mourning for the death of a relative is a sign that a wedding will soon take place in your family or that of some blood relation. To dream that some one registers your name at a hotel for you, denotes you will undertake some work which will be finished by others. To see others yawning, foretells that you will see some of your friends in a miserable state."
